Pokemon Battle Game

Welcome to the Pokemon Battle Game, a project created whilst I was on the CFG Python App course. This game is played in Python, where you can battle with the computer using Pokemon Stats. You can choose your own Pokemon or let the computer generate a random one for you. Whoever Pokemon Stat is higher is the winner. The score is then recorded each round, depending on how many rounds you want to play.

How to Play:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the file PokemonGame.py in your preferred Python IDE.
Run the file in your IDE.
Follow the prompts in the console to select your Pokemon or let the computer generate a random one.
Once both Pokemon have been selected, the game will begin.
Choose your Pokemon Stat. Whoever Stat is higher, is the winner.
The game will continue for as many rounds as you specify, with the winner of each round being recorded.
Once all rounds have been played, the final scores will be displayed.


Dependencies:

This project requires Python 3 to be installed on your machine.
